# SENTRY: Smart Warehouse Monitoring System

This project is designed to monitor employee and item movement within a warehouse using **face recognition** and **weight sensors**. It aims to improve security, ensure accurate inventory records, and detect potential theft or data inconsistencies.

## Key Features
- Automatic employee detection using face recognition
- Monitoring item check-in and check-out
- Weight tracking via shelf-mounted sensors
- Notifications for missing items or suspicious activity

## System Overview
Employees are recognized through a face recognition system when entering or exiting the warehouse. Items are scanned during both check-in and check-out, and shelf sensors track weight changes. The system compares scanned data with real-time sensor input to ensure consistency. If any mismatch is detected, the system sends a notification and logs the suspicious activity.
